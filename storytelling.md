##Mapping Workshop

Head on over [here](https://github.com/jkeefe/mapping-workshop-data/blob/master/follow-along.md) for that.

##Tips

- Do One Thing Well

- Big macro + big micro

- Make it beautiful

- Make it scan. Do you have to explain it all? How much?

- Offer it as part of your freelance package


##Pitfalls

- colors are your verbs - they can bias your presentation.

- non-zero based charts: [This is one of my favorites](http://feeling-data.tumblr.com/post/24479885347/cable-tv-graphic).

- you can put everything on a map. Don't.

- Don't let audience "find their own story"
    Here's everything I recorded for this project. Find your own story!

- Story of this geocoded place.
    Skeptical. High bar (audio tours).
    Needs specific purpose or way too much data.

- When a map is not a map
	- [Great article about this](http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/)
    - Often a chart is better
    - Especailly when you're trying to map lots of variables (like flooding and income)
    - Use when location is key to the story
    - Not for navigation

##A Word About Numeracy

Your sources are ahead of you

- Banks
- Politicians
- Candidates
- Police
- Non-profits
- For-profits

##A Word About Coding

- Knowing how to code will help you succeed
- Doesn't always have to be stuff that people will see/use
- Can help process your information
- Can help you watch things online (We Love Bots!)
- Find someone who can code, who you know well and can annoy, and learn their language

##A Word About Security

- Protecting you and your sources
- Concerns are not just NSA. Countries, competitors, private firms, ect too.
- End-to-end encryption
- Storage encryption your drive (easy!)
- Cloud encryption
- Check out these two Jonathan Stray articles:
	- [Security for Journalists, Part One: The Basics](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/security-journalists-part-one-basics/)
	- [Security for Journalists, Part two: Threat Modeling](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/security-journalists-part-two-threat-modeling/)
- How I did it is [posted here](http://johnkeefe.net/email-encryption-and-my-pgp-info).
