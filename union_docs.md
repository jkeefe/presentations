##Tips

- Do One Thing Well

- Big macro + big micro. .

- make it beautiful

- Make it scan
    Do you have to explain it all?
    How much?

- Offer it as part of your package



##Pitfalls

- colors are your verbs

- charts: cable TV usage.

- you can put everything on a map. Don't.

- Don't let audience "find their own story"
    Here's everything I recorded for this project. Find your own story!

- Story of this geocoded place.
    Skeptical. High bar (audio tours).
    Needs specific purpose or way too much data.

- When a map is not a map
    Often a chart is better
    Especailly when you're trying to map lots of variables (like flooding and income)
    Use when location is key to the story
    Not for navigation

##A Word About Numeracy

Your sources are ahead of you

- Banks
- Politicians
- Candidates
- Police
- Non-profits
- For-profits

##A Word About Coding

- Knowing how to code will help you succeed
- Doesn't always have to be stuff that people will see/use
- Can help process your information
- Can help you watch things online

##A Word About Security

- Protecting you and your sources
- Concerns are not just NSA. Private firms, too. Look at Uber story.
- end-to-end encrypted tech
- encrypt your drive (easy!)
