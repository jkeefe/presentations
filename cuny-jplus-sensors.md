# CUNY J+ Sensor Workshop

## Rundown

### Setup:
  - names / affiliations / what brings you here?
  - what could you sense in this room?
  - why would you do that?
  - think about stories on your beat (discuss later!)

### Why sensors are great for environmental/health reporting and why now

(6:30 pm, 10 min)

- Environmental issues are at the forefront
  - Flint, Michigan
  - West Virginia, Charleston - Elk River Spill
  - Fracking concerns

- Government agencies and scientists can’t measure everything 
  - [Air testing in NYC](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/air-quality-nyc-community-air-survey.page)
    - ~100 sites each season ... but only about a dozen monitors
  - Budget pressures
  - Rivers & Streams
  
- Emergence of "public science"
  - Wary of Big Science
  - Efforts such as [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/)
    - [DustDuino](https://publiclab.org/notes/Schroyer/11-23-2013/measure-coarse-and-fine-air-particulates-with-a-dustduino)
    - [Open Water Project](https://publiclab.org/wiki/open-water)
  - Local Activists: "Something's up here! Hey!"
  - Investigative Journalists: "Looks like something's up. What else could explain this?" 
  - Want to get it right/reputation. 
  
- Hardware is getting cheaper and cheaper
  - Conductivity monitors v arduinos
  - things you can detect:
    - (Have a bunch of these to show)
    * light
    * temperature
    * humidity
    * sound 
    * barometric pressure
    * wind (electric candle)
    * movement
    * location
    * [pH](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10972)
    * conductivity
    * soil moisture
    * turbidity (soon)
    * air particles
    * carbon monoxide
    * magnetic fields
    * water levels
    * [radiation](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11345)
    * anything on camera
 
### Case studies with show&tell

(6:40 pm 40 min)

  • AP Beijing Olympics
  • WNYC Cicadas
  • Columbia bicycle air sensors
  • U of Mo’s bar sound sensors
  • WNYC subway heat
  • WVU river bottles
 
### How not to make bad science

(7:20 pm 10 min)

- Be aware of the limits of what you can do. 
- Consult experts! 
  - Get them on board early
  - Need to have some who "play along"
    - Get that this isn't precise
    - Can guide you once you have results
    - Have gear to follow up your findings
  - Some say "you can't do this"
    - Super valuable, too
 
### Results: What can you expect to achieve with sensor journalism. 

(7:30 p.m. 10 min)

* Uncover stories
* Help people with their lives (ex: subway temperatures)
* Motivate new, real research
* Engage hobbyist/maker community
* spark conversations about the topic and about measurement 
 
### Break!

(7:40 pm, 20 mins)
 
### The technology of sensors, a quick overview.

(8 pm 10 min)

- physical change
- creates electrical change
- turned into information
- conveyed to a human

- **Demo the Arduino / Temp**
- Discuss all kinds of sensors
- Discuss all kinds of form factors
- Transmitting!
  
### Let’s build a water conductivity sensor! 

(8:10 pm, 55 min)

- Here are the parts you need: http://www.digikey.com/short/38vmfr
- My blog post on this is here: http://johnkeefe.net/make-every-week-audible-water-sensor
- Based on this post Don Blair at Public Lab: https://publiclab.org/notes/donblair/09-30-2014/coqui-bbv1-0 
  
### Idea-a-thon. 

(9:05 pm, 25 mins)

- Brainstorm sensor journalism story ideas
- discuss how to go about doing them

Also possible discussion on classic issues: 

- where to put the sensor
  * permission?
  * detect what you want?
  * redundancy
- how to protect it
  * weather
  * theft
- how to power it
  * batteries
  * solar power
  * sleep code
- how to get the data
  * look at a readout
  * store & retrieve
  * text
  * wifi
  * low-power radios 
 
### The end

(9:30 pm)
